## Progress

### Completed

- Front and rear triangle
- Components are modularized, and measurements / transforms are defined per part
- All components rendered with cuts so they can be rendered individually and 3D printed to use as live mocks

### WIP
- Making sure width between stays matches axle width (probably needs tweaking)
- Dropouts ?? (probably the "mount" piece just needs some modifications / cuts for axle)
- Derailleur hanger mount
  - Planning on using [GDH](https://velo-orange.com/blogs/theveloorangeblog/introducing-the-gdh-the-galactic-derailleur-hanger)

## Progress

### Completed

- [x] Simplified and rear triangle
- [x] Components are modularized, and measurements / transforms are defined per part
- [x] All components rendered with cuts so they can be rendered individually and 3D printed to use as live mocks

### WIP
- [ ] Seat stay / chain stay adjustments
  - [ ] Ensure right (drive side) seatstay / chainstay is offset enough for freehub cassette
  - [ ] Ensure width between stays matches freehub axle width (probably needs tweaking)
- [ ] Dropouts ?? (probably the "mount" piece just needs some modifications / cuts for axle)
- [ ] Derailleur hanger mount, planning on [GDH](https://velo-orange.com/blogs/theveloorangeblog/introducing-the-gdh-the-galactic-derailleur-hanger)
- [ ] Cable routing
